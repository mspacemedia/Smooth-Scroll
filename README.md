# Smooth Scroll Utility

## üí° About

The Smooth Scroll Utility is a simple, lightweight, and cross-browser JavaScript snippet designed for web developers, quality assurance (QA) testers, and content creators who need to record high-quality, jitter-free video demonstrations of webpages.

This utility creates a discreet, auto-hiding control panel that allows for consistent, slow, and smooth scrolling of any webpage, making your screen recordings professional and seamless.

Developed and open-sourced by **M-SpaceMedia**.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Cross-Browser/Cross-Device:** Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and is fully functional on mobile browsers (iOS/Android) for testing responsive designs.
* **Draggable Control Panel:** A small UI panel for easy operation that can be moved anywhere on the screen.
* **Auto-Hide Feature:** The panel automatically disappears when the smooth scroll starts and reappears when it stops, ensuring a clean recording.
* **Adjustable Speed:** Fine-tune the scroll speed in pixels per frame for perfect recording synchronization. (Lower is slower.)
* **Countdown Timer:** A 3-second countdown gives you time to prepare your screen recorder before the scroll begins.
* **Keyboard Shortcut:** Use **Ctrl** + **S** to quickly toggle the utility (start/stop/show panel).
